# Fund Allocation Governance Principles

These principles give direction to how the allocation of funds will be governed.

- **Responsibility** - Those involved in the design and in the operation of allocation are responsible to follow, in good faith, consensus-driven funding priorities and the principles outlined below.
- **Independence** - Prioritization and allocation should function independently of organizations operating in the community.
- **Diversity**  - Enable and encourage funds to be distributed to multiple funding groups.
- **Accountability** - Participants, including DAOs, are identified and/or verified. Decisions are informed with measurements and reporting from how funds are disbursed and used.
- **Transparency** - All membership transactions, funding, and referenda are on chain so the system is fully auditable and transparent.
- **Impactful** - Funding should maximize measurable impact under agreed-upon priorities.
- **Impermanence** - The infrastructure of the funding allocation should define an expiration date or endpoint, in order to prevent capture or ossification.
