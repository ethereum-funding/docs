# Block Rewards Mechanism Design Principles

These principles guide the design and operation of the of the block rewards mechanism 

- **Additive** - Any new block rewards introduced to the protocol are positioned as separate from the mining reward, acknowledging that all block rewards are paid for by every participant in the network.

- **Impermanent** - Any increase in block rewards will have an on-chain half life. Requiring social coordination and a hard fork to reimplement,

- **Transparent** - All transactions, funding, and referenda are on chain so the system is fully auditable and transparent.

- **Independant** - Disbursement mechanism acts independently of existing organizations presently operating in the community

- **Non-Custodial** - Reduce custody of funds or the accumulation of funds in the block rewards mechanism.
