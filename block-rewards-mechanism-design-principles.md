# Block Rewards Mechanism Design Principles

These principles guide the design and operation of the of the block rewards mechanism for community funding.

- **Additive** - Any new block rewards introduced to the protocol should be positioned as separate from the mining reward, acknowledging that all block rewards are paid for by every participant in the network.
- **Impermanent** - Any new block rewards introduced to the protocol should define an expiration date or endpoint, requiring social coordination and a hard fork to reimplement.
- **Transparent** - Transactions, referenda, and changes to configurations relating to the new block rewards are easily accessible on chain so that the system is auditable and transparent.
- **Non-Custodial** - Custody of funds or the accumulation of funds in the block rewards mechanism are minimized.
