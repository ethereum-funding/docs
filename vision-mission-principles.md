**Block Rewards Funding Initiative**
# Vision, Mission, and Principles

## Vision

We aim to solve for two important pain points in the community: the difficulty of making decisions about contentious issues, and the inadequate funding of important projects and infrastructure. 

To address these pain points, we propose a governance system which will enable transparent, informed decision-making about the protocol and funding priorities. We also propose a funding approach which will accumulate and channel resources toward the development and maintenance of key community projects.

## Mission

- To **educate** people in the community about the difficult issues facing us today, to illustrate the urgency of the situation, to channel our energy to addressing governance and funding.

- To **understand** the problems we face, to talk with stakeholder groups, to research governance of protocols and funding, to research funding proposals and learn which ones work and which ones fail.

- To **prototype** governance and funding systems, in order to learn how to responsibly govern, to learn how to responsibly fund initiatives, to learn how to hold everyone accountable to their responsibilities.

- To **advocate** to stakeholders in the current governance of the protocol and in funding that we can address the problems we face, that we can do so with the viable and sustainable solutions which we have prototyped and developed.

- To **build** these governance and funding systems, and to responsibly maintain these systems.
