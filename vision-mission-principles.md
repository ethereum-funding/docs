**Block Rewards Funding Initiative**
# Vision, Mission, and Principles

## Introduction

We have identified several important pain points in the community: the difficulty of making decisions about what to prioritize, the lack of representation in protocol-related decisions, and the inadequate funding of important projects and infrastructure. 

In our working groups there are important questions about how to tackle these issues, or even if we should tackle them all. As we explore these questions, we set down the following vision, mission, and operating principles to guide us.

## Vision

We propose a consensus-driven process which will enable transparent, informed decision-making about funding priorities. We also propose a funding approach which will use additional block rewards to channel more resources toward the development and maintenance of key community projects.

## Mission

- To **educate** people in the community about the difficult issues facing us today, to illustrate the urgency of the situation, to channel our energy to addressing prioritization and funding.

- To **understand** the problems we face, to talk with stakeholder groups, to research governance and management funding, to research relevant funding proposals and implementations.

- To **prototype** funding systems, in order to learn how to set priorities, to responsibly fund community initiatives, to learn how to hold everyone accountable to their responsibilities.

- To **advocate** to stakeholders in the community that we can address the problems we face with the solutions that we have prototyped and developed.

**To build a predictable, sustainable, and impactful funding system for the community, and to responsibly and maintain this system.**

## Not Our Mission

In the interest of maintaining focus, and out of respect for present institutions and arrangements, the Block Rewards Funding effort will avoid working toward certain outcomes.

- We do not intend to replace the role of the Ethereum Foundation.

- We do not intend to alter the manner in which the core devs operate.

- We do not intend to address the deeper issues of governance.

## Operating Principles

These principles describe the qualities we will have as we work to bring about block rewards funding.

- **Responsibility** - Take bold action, but do so respecting agreements and understand consequences.

- **Openness** - All are welcome to participate.

- **Transparency** - All work is as transparent as practical.

- **Teamwork** - Work is done in decentralized teams. Participants strive to coordinate action between teams.

- **Respectfulness** - Participants in the initiative respect each other,. Participants respect policies and processes adopted by teams.
